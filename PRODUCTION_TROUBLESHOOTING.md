# Production Deployment Troubleshooting

## Recent Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Environment Configuration
- ✅ Updated `render.yaml` with proper `APP_KEY`
- ✅ Added session security settings for HTTPS
- ✅ Configured database connection variables
- ✅ Set mail password for production
- ✅ Fixed middleware to only enforce HTTPS in production

### 2. What Was Fixed
The main issue was that the production server was missing the proper `APP_KEY` configuration, which caused the "No application encryption key has been specified" error.

## How to Check if Fixed

### 1. Check Render Deployment Status
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Check the latest deployment logs
- Look for successful build and deployment

### 2. Test the Application
- Visit: https://dabs-beauty-touch.onrender.com
- Should load without 500 errors
- Test the debug route: https://dabs-beauty-touch.onrender.com/debug/security

### 3. Expected Debug Output
The debug route should show:
```json
{
  "environment": "production",
  "app_url": "https://dabs-beauty-touch.onrender.com",
  "is_secure": true,
  "scheme": "https",
  "session": {
    "secure": true
  }
}
```

## If Still Having Issues

### Check Render Logs
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Check "Logs" tab for detailed error messages

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL database is connected in Render
   - Check database environment variables are properly set

2. **Build Failures**
   - Check Docker build logs in Render
   - Verify all dependencies are properly installed

3. **Migration Errors** 
   - Check if database tables exist
   - May need to run migrations manually

### Manual Commands (if needed)
If you need to run commands manually on Render:
- `php artisan migrate --force`
- `php artisan config:cache`
- `php artisan storage:link`

## Next Steps
1. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
2. Test the application URL
3. Check the debug route to verify configuration
4. Test form submission to ensure HTTPS and security work properly
