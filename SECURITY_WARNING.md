# SECURITY WARNING - CREDENTIALS EXPOSED

## ⚠️ URGENT: Your credentials were accidentally exposed in documentation files.

### What was exposed:
- APP_KEY (Laravel application key)
- MAIL_PASSWORD (Email password)

### Files that contained sensitive data:
- RENDER_ENV_CHECKLIST.md
- SERVER_ERROR_FIX.md
- RENDER_POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md
- SECURITY_FIX.md

### ✅ FIXED: 
All sensitive data has been removed from documentation files and replaced with placeholders.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

### 1. Generate New APP_KEY
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 2. Update Render Environment Variables
- Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service → Environment
- Update `APP_KEY` with the new key from above command
- Verify `MAIL_PASSWORD` is correct

### 3. Consider Changing Email Password
Since the email password was exposed in a public repository, consider:
- Changing the email account password
- Updating the `MAIL_PASSWORD` environment variable in Render

### 4. Review Security
- Check if any other credentials might be exposed
- Ensure `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- Never commit sensitive data to version control

## Prevention:
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Use placeholders like `[YOUR_KEY_HERE]` in documentation
- Double-check commits before pushing
